# Overcoming Occlusion with Inverse Graphics
This is the code for our ECCV16 paper on the Geometry meets Deep Learning workshop. Here you'll find the scene generator as well as the code for the models. The main libraries needed are:

- Blender (installed as a python module), so you can do "import bpy". Please follow [these instructions](https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/User:Ideasman42/BlenderAsPyModule).
- My updated versions of OpenDR and Chumpy you can [find here](https://github.com/polmorenoc/opendr).

Python 3.4+ is a requirement.
